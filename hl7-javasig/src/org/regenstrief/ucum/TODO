I decided to set the special dimensioned quantity issue asside
to move on with PQ and the HL7 stuff. I got stuck with that
I can't seem to solve the mystery of the special units. I don't
know is 

(a) 20 Cel * 2 = 40 Cel 

or 

(b) 20 Cel * 2 = (20 + 273.15) K * 2 = 586.3 K = 313.15 Cel

or 

(c) error, illegal argument

so, for now I just leave it without special units until I 
figured it out. Need to move on.
