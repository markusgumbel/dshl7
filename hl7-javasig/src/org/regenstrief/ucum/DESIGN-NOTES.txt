A Unit is a coded DimensionedQuantity. 

DimensionedQuantity implements the mathmatical concept
without regards to conventional name quantities (i.e.,
Units). That's why DimensionedQuantities can be 
easily computed without having to pay attention to
the Unit symbols etc. 

Units are then codes that have a DimensionedQuantity.
So Units implement the CS interface and they are
essentially DimensionedQuantities.

The HL7 PQ is more than just a DimensionedQuantity. It is
a DimensionedQuantity with a fixed Unit.

Special Units implement the CS interface and are 
SpecialDimensionedQuantities. SpecialDimensionedQuantities
is the abstract mathmathical substrate of special units.

How do DimensionedQuantities and SpecialDimensionedQuantities
relate? Either the Special.D.Q. is a specialization or they 
are entirely separate. The latter makes sense since the 
also have a name (e.g., Cel, degF). This requires to split interface from
implementation:

            DimensionedQuantity <--------------------+
               A                                     |
               |                                     |
               +----- RatioDimensionedQuantity       |
               |                                     |
               +----- SpecialDimensionedQuantity     |
               |                                     |
               +----- Unit --------------------------+

while Unit can be used as a dimensioned quantity, it really
needs to delegate the operations to the underlying Ratio or 
Special DimensionedQuantity.

Well, because of time constraints, I had to make degF and
Cel etc. work anyway. So I have just added it to Unit. The 
Dimensioned quantity is untouched.
